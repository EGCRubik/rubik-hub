# RubikHub

RubikHub is an open-access repository of Rubik-related datasets and research artefacts. We provide a friendly platform that integrates a local Zenodo-like service for dataset registration and DOI minting, and tools for dataset management and publication.

This project was developed as part of the EGC course (Evolución y Gestión de la Configuración / Evolution and Configuration Management).

## What we offer

- Public repository of datasets related to Rubik (feature models, datasets, examples).
- Web UI and API endpoints for uploading, versioning and publishing datasets.
- Test suites (unit, integration, selenium) and locust files for load testing.
